# Machine-Learning
In this repo, I am going to share some of my machine learning codes.

### SVR Energy Forecasting Model
The file 'input.csv' contains data on household energy consumption over a 24-hour period for 90 days.
I am using an SVR (Support Vector Regression) model to predict energy consumption on day 91. 
In the final step, the predicted results will be plotted alongside data from one sample day.
